#!/bin/sh
# The sanctioned way to end work and tidy worktrees. A worktree is a
# checkout, not the work: its commits live in the branch. This script
# removes a worktree only when its work has ended and the folder is clean,
# and it never loses a commit: a merged branch is on main, and a closed
# one is kept under an archive tag before its branch goes.
#
# Usage, from the main checkout:
#   sh scripts/worktrees.sh list
#       how many worktrees, in which folders, how many have ended
#   sh scripts/worktrees.sh audit [--days 3]
#       name the worktrees that are detached, whose pull request merged or
#       closed, or that have no open pull request and no commit in N days
#   sh scripts/worktrees.sh prune [--apply] [--closed] [--branches] [--branch NAME]
#       remove the clean worktrees of merged branches and their local
#       branches; with --closed also those of closed pull requests, after
#       tagging each branch as closed/NAME; with --branches also merged
#       local branches that have no worktree. Prints only, unless --apply.
#   sh scripts/worktrees.sh close PR "why, or what replaced it"
#       give a pull request its ending: comment, close, tag the branch as
#       closed/NAME, remove its worktree and its local branch.
#
# A worktree with uncommitted files outside .scratch/ is never removed; it
# is listed as skipped. On Windows, long paths are turned on and a linked
# node_modules is unlinked first, the two things that make removal fail.
