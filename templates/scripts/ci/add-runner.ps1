# Add a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner on this Windows machine, installed
# as a Windows service so it survives a restart and a logged-out user. Run
# it once for each runner you want: two is the recommended minimum, since a
# single runner makes every job wait for the last.
#
# Usage, from an elevated PowerShell in the project folder (it refuses to
# run unelevated, because installing a service needs it):
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\ci\add-runner.ps1 -Name build-2
# An agent can launch the elevated shell and the owner clicks the prompt:
#   Start-Process powershell -Verb RunAs -Wait -ArgumentList '-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\ci\add-runner.ps1 -Name build-2'
#
# It asks gh for a registration token (you must be signed in with gh and
# have admin rights on the repository), downloads the current runner into
# C:\actions-runner-<repo>\<Name> (one root per repository, so a second
# project's runner never lands inside the first's; -Root overrides it),
# configures it with the labels the workflows expect, and starts the
# service. It changes nothing else on the machine. Afterwards, run
# scripts/ci/runner-doctor.sh and the Runner check workflow.
