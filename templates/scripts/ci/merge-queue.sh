# The merge queue. Two modes:
#
#   --batch PR...   the default for more than two PRs. Make an integration
#                   branch from main, merge each PR in the order given with
#                   a merge commit, run the type-check and only the test
#                   files that PR touched after each merge, drop a PR that
#                   conflicts or goes red, rebuild the status page, push,
#                   open one PR that closes every carried issue, wait for
#                   the one full CI run, merge it, then run the serial
#                   queue for anything dropped.
#
#   --serial PR...  one at a time, as before. Merge a green PR without a
#                   re-run when main moved only outside its classes; update
#                   the branch so CI runs again when it moved inside them.
#
# Usage: sh scripts/ci/merge-queue.sh [--batch | --serial] [--base BRANCH] PR...
#        sh scripts/ci/merge-queue.sh PR [BASE]            (one PR, serial, as before)
#
# Two or fewer PRs with no flag run serially. More than two with no flag is
# refused by the require-batch-merge hook; name the mode.
#
# Needs git, gh (signed in), and for batch mode a project with a
# type-check and a test runner. Override the commands with
# QUEUE_TYPECHECK_COMMAND and QUEUE_TEST_COMMAND (the latter takes one
# file as its argument). Turn off "require branches to be up to date" in
# branch protection; this script is the queue. See scripts/ci/QUEUE.md.
