# Self-hosted runners

A runner that fails quietly costs more than a slow one: every check sits queued or fails for no reason anyone can see. These are the rules that keep that from happening.

## Install each runner as a service

A runner started by hand in a terminal stops when the terminal closes, the user logs out, or the machine restarts, and nothing says so. Install it as a Windows service instead. `scripts/ci/add-runner.ps1 -Name NAME` does the whole thing: registration token, download, configuration with the labels the workflows expect, service install and start. A runner installed by hand can be moved over with `config.cmd remove`, then the script.

The script needs an elevated PowerShell, because installing a service does, and it refuses to run without one. An agent can launch the elevated shell and the owner clicks the prompt once:

```powershell
Start-Process powershell -Verb RunAs -Wait -ArgumentList '-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\ci\add-runner.ps1 -Name build-2'
```

Each repository's runners live under their own root, `C:\actions-runner-<repo>`, so a second project's runner never lands inside the first project's runner folder; `-Root` overrides it.

The service runs as NETWORK SERVICE, which sees only the machine PATH, not your user PATH. Git, Node and gh must be on the machine PATH. The doctor checks that. The doctor also knows when every runner on the machine is a service: the two warnings that only apply to a runner started by hand (the `NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath` variable and the execution policy) become notes.

## The shell every step runs in

On a Windows runner the service account's `bash` and `sh` resolve to the WSL stub, and every step fails before it starts. `ci.yml` and `queue-drain.yml` carry a `RUN_SHELL` placeholder in their workflow-level `defaults.run.shell`; on Windows runners set it to Git's bash by its short path, `'C:\PROGRA~1\Git\bin\bash.exe --noprofile --norc -eo pipefail {0}'`, and on hosted runners to `bash`. A PowerShell step says `shell: powershell`, never `pwsh`: PowerShell 7 from the Store lives in a user folder the service cannot see. The gh-only workflows (audit, board sync, state label, runner watch) stay on hosted runners and keep `shell: sh`.

## Run two

One runner is a queue of one: a slow job makes every other job wait, and when it goes offline everything stops. Run at least two, on the same machine or on two. Each is one run of `add-runner.ps1` with a different name.

## Keep the runner's environment clean

A runner picks up whatever environment it starts with, and so does every job it launches. Keep tool settings out of the machine environment and out of the runner's `.env` file; set what a job needs in the workflow's `env:` block, where it is visible and scoped to that job. The `Runner check` workflow prints what a job actually sees.

**The one that bit a real project: `NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath`.** Git Bash sets it to 1. A runner started with `run.cmd` from a Git Bash window inherits it, and so does every job. With it set, the Windows command prompt will not run a program from the current folder by its bare name. An Android step that ran `gradlew.bat` failed with "'gradlew.bat' is not recognized as an internal or external command", while the `if not exist gradlew.bat` check just before it passed, because that looks for a file, not a program. Three fixes, any one of which holds:

1. **Run the runner as a service** (`add-runner.ps1`). A service never inherits a shell's environment. This is the fix.
2. **Call programs from the repository with a path**: `.\gradlew.bat`, not `gradlew.bat`. That works whatever the setting, and is right in the workflow regardless.
3. **Clear it at the start of a cmd step**: `set NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath=`.

To start a runner by hand from Git Bash anyway, strip it first: `env -u NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath cmd //c run.cmd`. The doctor warns when the shell you run it from sets the variable.

## Nobody stops the daemon

A build daemon (Gradle's, Nx's, the .NET build server) is one process for every build on the machine. On a machine that also hosts a runner, an agent that runs `gradlew --stop` from its worktree, meaning to tidy up, kills the runner's daemon mid-build, and the android job fails with "Gradle build daemon has been stopped". The `block-loose-ends` hook refuses `gradlew --stop`, `gradle --stop`, `nx reset`, `nx daemon --stop` and `dotnet build-server shutdown`. Stopping what you started means your own servers and watchers; a daemon idles out on its own. If no runner is on the machine, `DAEMON_STOP_OK=1` in front of the command says so.

## Before the first run, and after any change to the machine

1. `sh scripts/ci/runner-doctor.sh` on the machine: which bash a step gets, whether Git, Node and gh are on the machine PATH, whether the shell you are in would leak `NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath` into a runner, PowerShell's execution policy, and whether each runner is online.
2. The `Runner check` workflow from the Actions tab: Git's bash named by path, a PowerShell step, the tools the job sees, and a cmd step that says whether jobs inherited `NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath` and runs a program from the current folder by path.

## When it goes wrong anyway

`Runner watch` runs hourly on a hosted runner, so it works when ours are down. It comments on the issue labeled `audit` when a runner is offline, when fewer than two are online, or when any run has sat queued for more than ten minutes, and says nothing otherwise. The merge queue also says "GitHub Actions is down, not your code" when the hosted side is the problem, so the two are never confused.
