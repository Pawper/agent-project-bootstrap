# generated page. The rule it enforces: a generated page is built from stubs,
# so a hand edit is lost on the next build and collides with every other agent.
#
# The list of generated pages is read from .claude/generated-pages.txt in the
# project, one shell glob per line. When that file is missing the list is
# just STATUS.md.
