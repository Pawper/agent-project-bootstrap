# PreToolUse hook for Bash: every merge goes through the project's queue.
#
#   - A direct `gh pr merge` is refused when the project has the queue
#     script, because the queue is what checks the folder, waits for a quiet
#     main, batches, cleans up the worktree and records flaky tests. One
#     rule in CLAUDE.md is easy to miss; a refusal is not.
#   - More than two PRs through merge-queue.sh need --batch, --serial or
#     --drain: the batch is the unit of merging; serial is the exception
#     you name.
