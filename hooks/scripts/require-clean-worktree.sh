# Stop and SubagentStop hook: a clean folder is part of "done".
#
# It acts only inside a linked worktree, where an agent works on one task.
# In the main checkout a person is usually mid-work, and it stays out of
# the way. Before the agent may finish it checks three things:
#   1. nothing modified or untracked outside the scratch folder (.scratch/);
#   2. no images, video or build output left in the worktree;
#   3. no process still running from the worktree folder.
# It refuses once, names what it found, and says what to do. It kills
# nothing and removes nothing. If the agent stops again without fixing it,
# the second stop goes through, so a session can never be trapped.
