# Read the approval for the latest proposal on the project's drive issue.
# Read-only: it prints the approved goals, or says there is nothing to do.
#
# The drive issue is the open issue labeled "drive". A proposal is a comment
# that starts with "Proposal". An approval is the newest comment after that
# proposal written by someone other than the proposer, whose first line is
# "all", "none", a list of numbers, or "all but" a list of numbers.
#
# Usage, from the project root: sh "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/drive/approval.sh"
# Prints: the approved goal lines, one per line, then "approved by NAME"; or
# one line saying why there is nothing: no drive issue, no proposal, no
# reply yet, or a reply that approved nothing.
