# Bring a project's copies of the plugin's scripts up to date with the
# installed plugin. A project copies the templates once, at bootstrap, and
# nothing refreshes them, so a project can run a merge queue from weeks ago
# while the plugin has moved on: one project asked for a batch mode its own
# copy of the queue did not have.
#
# Usage, from the project root:
#   sh "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sync/sync-templates.sh"          report only
#   sh "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sync/sync-templates.sh" --apply  update, on a new branch
#   ... --apply --force   also replace plugin-owned files the project edited
#
# What it does with each kind of file:
#   - Plugin-owned scripts and workflows (templates/OWNED.txt): reported when
#     missing or different; with --apply, written from the plugin. One the
#     project has edited since it was copied (more than one commit touches
#     it) is kept and named, unless --force: a local exception in a check
#     was once replaced without a word, and CI went red on the next push.
#   - Config with defaults: added when missing; never replaced.
#   - The project's own files (ci.yml, .gitattributes, .gitignore):
#     never touched; it reports the jobs and lines the template has that
#     the project's copy lacks, for a person to merge by hand.
#
# --apply needs a clean working tree. It makes a branch named
# template-sync-<date> from the current commit, writes the files there and
# commits them, so every change is a reviewable diff in a pull request and
# the old versions stay in git. It does not push.
